/**
 * Design a Tic-tac-toe game that is played between two players on a n x n grid.

 You may assume the following rules:

 A move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block.
 Once a winning condition is reached, no more moves is allowed.
 A player who succeeds in placing n of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

 Example:

 Given n = 3, assume that player 1 is "X" and player 2 is "O" in the board.

 TicTacToe toe = new TicTacToe(3);

 toe.move(0, 0, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
 |X| | |
 | | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (0, 0).
 | | | |

 toe.move(0, 2, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
 |X| |O|
 | | | |    // Player 2 makes a move at (0, 2).
 | | | |

 toe.move(2, 2, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
 |X| |O|
 | | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 2).
 | | |X|

 toe.move(1, 1, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
 |X| |O|
 | |O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 1).
 | | |X|

 toe.move(2, 0, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
 |X| |O|
 | |O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 0).
 |X| |X|

 toe.move(1, 0, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
 |X| |O|
 |O|O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 0).
 |X| |X|

 toe.move(2, 1, 1); -> Returns 1 (player 1 wins)
 |X| |O|
 |O|O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 1).
 |X|X|X|

 Follow up:
 Could you do better than O(n2) per move() operation?

 Hint:

 Could you trade extra space such that move() operation can be done in O(1)?
 You need two arrays: int rows[n], int cols[n], plus two variables: diagonal, anti_diagonal.
